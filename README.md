# Authentik Landing Page
# Overview
This project brings the Authentik landing page to life with a clean, modern design that works beautifully on any device. The focus is on delivering a smooth, responsive experience that feels natural and inviting, using React and effective modern tooling.

# Design Approach and Implementation

The landing page is implemented as a React app, leveraging components for clear structure and reusability. Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS, enabling rapid development and straightforward customization. Semantic JSX is used for accessibility and clarity. Interactivity, including the dark/light theme toggle and the mobile menu dropdown, is managed using minimal React state and event handlers to keep the interface simple and user-friendly.
