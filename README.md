# Authentik Landing Page
# Overview
This project brings the Authentik landing page to life with a clean, modern design that works beautifully on any device. The focus was on creating a smooth, responsive experience that feels natural and inviting, using simple but effective tools.

# Design Approach and Implementation
The approach focused on creating a clean, responsive design that works well across all devices. The layout adapts smoothly from mobile to desktop, ensuring a consistent user experience. Colors and typography were selected to provide a warm and inviting feel.
The implementation uses semantic HTML and Tailwind CSS for styling, which allows for rapid development and easy customization. JavaScript is used minimally to add interactivity, such as the dark/light theme toggle and the mobile menu dropdown, keeping the interface simple and user-friendly.
